## Problem Definition
Currently in the manufacturing industry, preventive maintenance is conducted numerous times during an equipment life cycle, in order to get the most out of it. These maintenance process usually takes long and use up useful labor costs and sometimes expensive tools.
With predictive maintenance, you can pick out issues using historical information to deetermine when the next fault might happen, and plan better for maintenance, rather than conducting maintenance more than needed. It uses sensor information like vibration, humidity etc, and runs it through a machine learning tool to estimate and determine the best course of action.
In the manufacturing sector preventive maintenance is routinely performed multiple times throughout an equipment's lifecycle to maximize operational efficiency. However, these procedures are often time constraints, labor costly, and may require expensive tools.
By contrast, predictive maintenance leverages historical data to anticipate potential equipment failure, enabling more efficient maintenance scheduling and reducing unnecessary interventions. This approach utilizes sensor data such as vibration and humidity measurements, which are analyzed using machine learning algorithms to assess equipment condition and recommend optimal maintenance strategies.

## Dataset
